Kameleoon allows you to easily customize your blog's design: change colors or fonts; add gradients, rounded corners to your template. Instantly!

== Description ==

Kameleoon is a web design tool that allows you to instantly modify the visual appearance of your blog (or other website). Thanks to its easy yet powerful GUI, you can author beautiful and professional looking themes - without knowing CSS or HTML. Kameleoon is compatible with all WordPress templates, which means you can install a template and further customize it to your tastes. However, <a href="http://www.kameleoon.com/resources/wordpress">
we maintain a collection of recommanded templates</a> (templates that have been analyzed and slightly modified by our team to guarantee you a full compatibility). Use one of these if you run into troubles with your own template (or contact us so we can port your template to Kameleoon).

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `kameleoon` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Create your Kameleoon account from the configuration page of the Kameleoon plugin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What will Kameleoon allow me to do? =

Kameleoon will give you total control over your website's appearance, allowing you to entirely customize web pages directly from your favorite browser. You will be able to create beautifully designs without any knowledge of HTML or CSS, and without any additional software. Thanks to advanced effects and intelligence, our web-application helps non-designers to author professionally looking designs.

= So is Kameleoon right for me? =

You will love Kameleoon if you have an existing site and want to customize its appearance easily, as often as you like. If you already use a template but want to modify it, Kameleoon is the tool of choice. If you're building a website from scratch, our service can also greatly help you reducing your development costs: you will only have to code the layout (position of elements) and all the decorations can be quickly added with Kameleoon.

= Is Kameleoon easy to use? What level of control is offered? =

We developed Kameleoon with ease of use in mind. If you can use web applications such as Gmail, you will be able to learn Kameleoon quickly. The interface can be a bit complex at the beginning, but that's because we offer a very high level of control. For each element on the page, you can change its background, its borders, the text size and color, and add special effects like shadows or gradients. The base functionality of our software can be learnt in less than an hour, and everything the results of your changes are viewable directly in your browser!
